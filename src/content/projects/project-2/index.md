Starting off as just a single block, I solo developed a 3D block engine capable of handling thousands of chunks and millions of blocks. The engine is built with a variety of features, including chunking, many types of culling, terrain generation, a lighting system, inventory system, and dungeon generator. The engine was created in C# through the Monogame framework.
