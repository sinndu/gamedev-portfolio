Last.fm Higher or Lower is a web game which utilizes Last.FM's music and user database API to create a custom tailored game for the user. Fetching your song scrobble data, the game allows users to guess if they have listened to a song more or less than another fetched song. Solo developed in HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
